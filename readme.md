### SatRday 2019 Talk - Reference classes, an antidote to complexity.

Open the main project file with RStudio.

 * `graph_fns.R` defines the reference classes that were used to do the modelling. 
 * `graph_fns.cpp` has the method definitions and integration with the boost-cpp-libraries for doing shortest-path routing across a DAG.
 * `static_plots.R` will allow you to generate any of the html interactive charts that are references by the presentation markdown file.
 * `final_presso.html` the presentation that was delivered with zest at satRday2019
 * `/presentation/ReferenceClasses.Rpres` can be opened in RStudio and "previewed" in the built-in viewer. 
   * Once you've built a preview, click on the "more" dropdown and "save as web page" which will save the whole presentation in html/slideshow viewable format.
